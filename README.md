# Aural Alert
This project investigates how VBAP can improve the clarity, directionality, and urgency of emergency signals. By embedding spatial and contextual cues into alerts, we aim to enhance user response and decision-making in real-world scenarios, using both headphones and speakers.

#### Implementation Status
- âœ… Dataset loading and siren extraction
- âœ… Basic audio playback
- âœ… Spatial audio processing (Audio Lab)
- ðŸš§ Room acoustics simulation
