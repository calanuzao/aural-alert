# aural-alert
This project investigates how 3D audio techniques like HRTFs, VBAP, and BRIRs can improve the clarity, directionality, and urgency of emergency signals. By embedding spatial and contextual cues into alerts, we aim to enhance user response and decision-making in real-world scenarios, using both headphones and speakers.
